### Added animations accomplishing the tasks using cv2-dnn. Created these using python purely. The python codes are provided right up there!<img src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/TartTastyHammerheadbird-size_restricted.gif" height=50 width=50>

    Used deques (Double-Ended Queues) to achieve the rate of disappearance of points from numpy array of the video.
    
    We will further make use of pytorch file AgeGender.ipynb to achieve 100% verification of the person alongside security.
    
    Further, it can be interpreted that these are basically Augmented-Reality/Virtual-Reality applications. 
    
    Now you know how much Unity Player has to work on the backend (using python) to create Gaming Environments and AR/VR.

### Here is a program for tracing contents (hand written). ASHA workers can be trained via mediums like these.
### So keeping in mind the future of the nation, We can only say:-
![Nice](https://github.com/Vedant-S/CoViD-PDS-Plus/blob/master/Code/ML_Applications/Deep_Learning/nice.gif) 
# Nice!

## Another implemented code to train NGO's and other organizations to provide for the disabled. So that in all this rush people from all social/economic background, the disabled do not suffer. The ASHA workers must be prepared for all eventuality!

### In these times, with people having an idle mind,wrongful entry of data(i.e pranks) must be avoided. So, we have used an audio file for verification of User. If you are over the age of 35, you will not be able to hear the following audio:-

### Mind You, it is a screeching sound only young ones can hear. Young ones, try it on your parents. They won't hear a thing!

## Besides basic audio files, there are Image and Video-Capture detection models, which we shall use for verification of entered data.
